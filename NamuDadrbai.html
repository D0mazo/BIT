        Gere began appearing in <a href="#">Hollywood</a> films in the mid-1970s. Originally cast in a starring role in <a href="#"><i>The Lords of Flatbush</i></a> (1974),
         he was replaced after fighting with his co-star <a href="#">Sylvester Stallone</a>. He played a small but memorable part 
         in <a href=""><i>Looking for Mr. Goodbar</i></a> (1977) and starred in director <a>Terrence Malick's</a> well-reviewed drama <a><i>Days of Heaven</i></a> (1978).<a><sup>[7]</sup></a>
          The crime drama <a href=""><i>American Gibolo</i></a> (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama <a href="#"><i>An Officer and a Gentleman</i></a> (1982)
           (co-starring <a href="#">Debra Winger</a>) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million[13] and winning 
           two <a href="#">Academy Awards</a> out of six nominations;<a href="#"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Gere himself received his first <a href="#">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination.<a href="#">[15]</a>

           His career rebounded with the releases of <a href="#"><i>Internal Affairs</i></a> (1990) <a href="#"><i>Pretty Woman</i></a>and (1990), the latter of which earned 
           him his second <a href="#">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination.<a href="#"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including <a href="#"><i>Sommersby</i></a> (1993) 
           (opposite <a href="#">Jodie Foster</a>),<a href="#"><i>Primal Fear </i></a> (1996) and <a href="#"><i>Runaway Bride</i></a> (1999) (which reunited him with his 
           Pretty Woman co-star <a href="#">Julia Roberts</a>).<a href="#"><sup>[16]</sup></a> He also took a leading role in the action thriller <a href="#"><i>The Jackal</i></a> (1997), 
           playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.<a href="#"><sup>[19]</sup></a><br>
        
        Gere was named <a href="#"><i>People</i></a> magazine's <a href="#">"Sexiest Man Alive"</a> in 1999. Not long thereafter, all in the same year, he appeared in the hit 
        films <a href="#"><i>The Mothman Prophecies</i></a> (2002), <a href="#"><i>Unfaithful</i></a> (2002) and the <a href="#">Academy Award</a>-winning <a href="#">musical film adaptation <i>Chicago</i></a> (2002),<a href="#"><sup>[7]</sup></a> 
        for which he won his first  <a href="#">Golden Globe Award</a>. Gere's <a href="#">ballroom dancing</a> drama <a href="#"><i>Shall We Dance?</i></a> (2004) was also a solid performer 
        that grossed $170 million worldwide.<a href="#"><sup>[20]</sup></a> His next film, the book-to-screen adaptation <a href="#"><i>Bee Season</i></a> (2005), was a commercial failure.<a href="#"><sup>[21]</sup></a>
         Gere went on to co-star with <a href="#">Jesse Eisenberg</a>
         and <a href="#">Terrence Howard </a>in <a href="#"><i>The Hunting Party</i></a> (2007), a thriller in which 
         he played a journalist in Bosnia. He next appeared with <a href="#">Christian Bale</a>, <a href="#">Heath Ledger</a> and <a href="#">Cate Blanchett</a> in <a href="#">Haynes' </a> 
         semi-biographical film about <a href="#">Bob Dylan</a>, <a href="#"><i>I'm Not There </i></a>(2007); Gere was one of six actors to portray a variation of Dylan. 
         He co-starred with <a href="#">Diane Lane</a> in the romantic drama <a href="#"><i>Nights in Rodanthe </i></a>(2008). The film was widely panned by critics<a href="#"><sup>[22]</sup></a> 
         (making #74 on The Times Worst Films of 2008 list),<a href="#"><sup>[23]</sup></a> but grossed over $84 million worldwide.<a href="#"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
         The film is his most recent to have been produced entirely by a <a href="#">major film studio</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Gere has expressed a belief that his politics regarding China, an important financial resource for major Hollywood studios, 
        have made him <a href="#">unwelcome within Hollywood</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[25]</sup></a> He embraced his apparent exile from Hollywood and instead appeared in independent films
         that garnered some of the best reviews of his career.<a href="#"><sup>[17]</sup></a> He was notably singled out for portraying businessman 
         Robert Miller in <a href="#">Arbitrage <i></i></a>(2012), earning his fourth <a href="#">Golden Globe Award</a> nomination. Among many positive reviews,<a href="#"><sup>[26]</sup></a>
         <a href="#">Peter Travers</a> of <a href="#"><Rolling Stone i></i></a>cited Gere's performance as "too good to ignore" and "an implosive tour de force".<a href="#"><sup>[27]</sup></a> 
         <a href="#">Lou Lumenick</a> of <a href="#"><i>the New York Post</i></a> further wrote that he "gives the best performance of his career".<a href="#"><sup>[28]</sup></a> Also in 2012, 
         he received the <a href="#">Golden Starfish Award</a> for Lifetime Achievement from the <a href="#">Hamptons International Film Festival</a> 
         and the Career Achievement Award from the <a href="#">Hollywood Film Awards</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[29]</sup></a><a href="#"><sup>[30]</sup></a> He had earlier received an award from 
         the <a href="#">34th Cairo International Film Festival</a> in December 2010.<a href="#"><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>
        
        <p>Gere made a notable departure from his traditional screen persona with <a href="#">Joseph Cedar</a>'s political drama <a href="#"><i>Norman</i></a> (2016). 
        The film saw him portray Norman Oppenheimer, a small-time Jewish <a href="#">fixer</a>. Gere himself described the character as an 
        embodiment of the "sides of us we know are annoying and needy".<a href="#"><sup>[32]</sup></a>His portrayal of Oppenheimer was called "consistently, 
        completely fascinating" by <a href="#">RogerEbert.com</a><a href="#"><sup>[33]</sup></a> and was singled out as a worthy <a href="#">Academy Award</a> contender by <a href="#"><i></i>Variety</a>.<a href="#"><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>
        
        <p>Gere is an accomplished musician, composing and performing the Pretty Woman piano theme and a guitar solo in 
        Runaway Bride. He learned tap dance for his role as lawyer Billy Flynn in Chicago,<a href="#"><sup>[35]</sup></a>and karate for <b>An Officer and a Gentleman</b> 
        .<a href="#"><sup>[36]</sup></a></p>
        
        <p>Multiple film critics and media outlets have cited Gere as one of the best actors never to have received an <a href="#">Academy Award</a> nomination.
